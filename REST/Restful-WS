### Restful Web Services:

      Restful Web Services is a stateless client-server architecture where web services are resources and can be identified by their URIs.

      REST Client applications can use HTTP GET/POST methods to invoke Restful web services. REST doesn’t specify any specific protocol to use,
      but in almost all cases it’s used over HTTP/HTTPS. When compared to SOAP web services, these are lightweight and doesn’t follow any standard.
      We can use XML,JSON, text or any other type of data for request and response.
