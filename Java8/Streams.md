## JAVA8 

A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
Streams donâ€™t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
