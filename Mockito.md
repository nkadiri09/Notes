# Benefits of Mockito

No Handwriting − No need to write mock objects on your own.

Refactoring Safe − Renaming interface method names or reordering parameters will not break the test code as Mocks are created at runtime.

Return value support − Supports return values.

Exception support − Supports exceptions.

Order check support − Supports check on order of method calls.

Annotation support − Supports creating mocks using annotation.

  The Mockito.mock() method allows us to create a mock object of a class or an interface.

  Then, we can use the mock to stub return values for its methods and verify if they were called
