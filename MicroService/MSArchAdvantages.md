# Advantages of MicroService Archetecture.

## Benefits of Microservices Architecture

It tackles the problem of complexity by decomposing application into a set of manageable services which are much faster to develop, and much easier to understand and maintain.
It enables each service to be developed independently by a team that is focused on that service.
It reduces barrier of adopting new technologies since the developers are free to choose whatever technologies make sense for their service and not bounded to the choices made at the start of the project.
Microservice architecture enables each microservice to be deployed independently. As a result, it makes continuous deployment possible for complex applications.
Microservice architecture enables each service to be scaled independently.
